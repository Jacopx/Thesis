\section{General Problem}
Forecasting is one of the most critic part of a company, it could drive to easily success as well as drive to failure. A software project is not different from a manufacturing product, its development, infact, require analysis of different kind, from resources needed to costs and time required.\\
The software development experience shows that the process of analysis is really difficult, due to the nature of the problem, coding is a mind product and the time required to produce it can varying in accord to a lot of different factors.

\chapter{Datasets}
The following section illustrate the structure of the all the principal datasets used during this thesis project.
\section{SEOSS33}
The SEOSS33\cite{SEOSS33} is a \href{https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PDDZ4Q}{dataset} collecting bug, issue, reports, commit and lot of other information of 33 open source project, following their progress via sourcing platform. The dataset is enriched also with time stamps, release versions, component information and developer comments.\\
At today there are no other public research conducted over this datasets, this works seems to be first.\\
The data is retrived by the issue tracking system (ITS) and the version control system (VCS), the process is shown in figure \ref{fig:seoss33_retrival}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure/seoss33_retrival.png}
  \caption{SEOSS33 data retrival}
  \label{fig:seoss33_retrival}
\end{figure}

To unify the project specific difference, the typed issue, e.g. \textit{New Feature} or \textit{Bug Report}, are mapped to five issue categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bug: A problem which impairs or prevents the functions of the product
  \item Feature: A new feature of the product
  \item Improvement: An enhancement to an existing feature
  \item Task: A task that needs to be done
  \item Other: Various
\end{itemize}

The study collects 33 projects that are using Atalassian Jira and git, for popularity reasons. Is also required that the projects in the dataset should be majorly written in one programming language, Java is choosen. Due to machine learning nature, the choosen project must have great number of issue, all project were in development for at least three years. Among these products we have selected five of them, because of size, as shown in table \ref{tab:seoss33_selected}:

\begin{center}
  \captionof{table}{Project data distribution} \label{tab:seoss33_selected}
  \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| }
     \hline
     \textbf{Project} & \textbf{Month} & \textbf{Issue} \\
     \hline
     \hline
     Hadoop & 150 & $39086$ \\
     Hbase & 131 & $19247$ \\
     Maven & 183 & $18025$ \\
     Cassandra & 106 & $13965$ \\
     Hive & 113 & $18025$ \\
     \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

More selection charactheristics can be found in chapter 2.1 \cite{SEOSS33}.\\

Is fundamental to understand the structure of this dataset, the majority of the forecasting operation tests are conducted using the data stored by this research.\\
Each project is stored in a SQLITE file, a SQL offline database, the structure is based on the entity of the \textit{issue}, identified by an \textit{issue\_id}, the other tables are used to link additional information, like the number of commit, the version referred, comments and others features. The figure \ref{fig:seoss33_db} show the database schema.

\chapter{Machine Learning models}
\section{Introduction}
Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead\cite{ml}. The word ML is almost in the public domain now, in the last decades the usage of these kind of algorithms has drammatically raisen although most of it had already been developed for years. The main reason is the increase in the computational capacity of the systems.\\
There a lot of different models available, the following chapters will focus on the models used in this project.

\section{Supervised Learning}
% MISSING INTRODUCTION
\paragraph{Random Forest}
Random Forest (RF) is a supervised learning algorithm which uses ensemble learning method for classification and regression. The forest is made by lot of different decision tree, its basic unit. The structure of the decision tree is simple, each branch define a direction to follow based on the values of different features, the end of a branch, the leaf, instead is the final predicted value. When all the trees are trained the model can be used, all the features value are evaluated by all the trees, than using some aggregation technique the final predicted value is computed. Using lot of different decision tree reduce the habit of overfitting. The behaviour is similar even for classification. Figure \ref{fig:rf} shows a simplified schema of the model.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure/rf.png}
  \caption{Random Forest simplified scheme \cite{rf}}
  \label{fig:rf}
\end{figure}

The main advantages are that is efficent on large databases, can handle a lot of input variables without variable deletion, it generate an unbiased estimate of the generalization error for the build process and it can handle missing data.
One of the drawback of this technique is the habit to overfit in particular condition, depending on datasets.

\paragraph{Gradient Boosting}
% MISSING

\section{Neural Networks}
Neural Networks (NN) are algorithm, for pattern recognition, inspired by the structure of the human brain, with elaboration units (neurons) and connection network (synapses), exposed to enough of the right data, this kind of algorithms is able to establish correlations between present and future events. Figure \ref{fig:nn} shows a simplyfied versiona of a neural network.\\
NN can be used to solve different kind of problems, classification, clustering and regression. Our problem will be solved using the regressive type.\\
Regression analysis can be used to forecast one or more label based to other features.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure/nn.png}
  \caption{Structure of a neural network}
  \label{fig:nn}
\end{figure}
The structure of these networks can be really complicated and a whole thesis can be made upon this topic that, for this reason, will not more discussed.

\paragraph{Recurrent Neural Networks}
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) is a class of NN that keep connections between nodes and a temporal sequence. The main difference, respect NN, is that has feedback connections, this memory allow to keep track of temporal dynamic behaviour, they can process single data point or entire sequence of data, like video or speech.

\paragraph{Long-Short Term Memory}
One of the most used type of RNN is the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), were developed to solve the problems of exploding and vanishing of gradient typical of normal RNN.

\chapter{Forecasting}
\section{Introduction}
Forecasting is the process of making predictions of future based on past and present data by trends analysis. Forecasting is one of the most desired machine learning functionality, it could be used to improve each kind of process, from finacials to production ones. Of course this task is not easy to achieve, a lot of resources and studies are needed to accomplish it.
The software development is identical to a product development process, starts from the ideation and ends with the production itself.
The goal is to predict the defectiveness in order to efficently allocate the development effort.

\section{Features}
The main advantage, in data analysis, of machines is that they can compute a lot of different data and finding a lot of patterns and correlation that human can't find. Combine the human attitude of logical correlations and machines capacity of number analysis can drive to a powerful combination that can drastically improve the forecasting ability.
Each artificial intelligence algorithms require a correct and properly studied data in order to perform a valuable prediction, one of the basic step is the data preparation, providing correct and organized data is fundamental to correctly fit the network over the problem.
